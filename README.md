# OS Lab

Nexpos

This repository contains my implementation of Project eXpOS (eXperimental Operating System) done as part of the Operating Systems Laboratory course I took in 2022.

More details about the project can be found on the website.

This branch contains the dual-core implementation of the OS (Stage 28).
