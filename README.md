# OS Lab

Nexpos

This repository contains my implementation of Project eXpOS (eXperimental Operating System) done as part of the Operating Systems Laboratory course I took in 2022.

This Experimental Operating System was written in SPL(System Programmer's Language) which is an enriched assembly language programming system for writing protected mode programs for the XSM(Experimental String Machine) machine(simulator for running the OS).

I have hard coded the hardware and software ISR,modules and exception handler from scratch using SPL language.

The predefined SPL Compiler then converts this code into XSM CODE which is an assembly level code.

More details about the project can be found on the below website:

This branch contains the dual-core implementation of the OS (Stage 28).
